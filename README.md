# ConexiÃ³n Femenina - Official Website

## Description

**Please note: This is the first version of the website, developed in a single day due to the project's urgent requirements.**

This repository contains the source code for the official website of **ConexiÃ³n Femenina**, an organization dedicated to empowering women in Chincha, Peru, through educational programs, personal development, support, and solidarity campaigns. The website serves as an informational platform to present the organization's mission, vision, values, programs, campaigns, and activities, as well as to facilitate contact and donations.

## Main Features

* **Detailed Information:** Presents sections about the organization ("About Us"), its programs ("She Speaks English," "Amongst Ourselves," "Connection Without Barriers," "Inspiring Cohort"), solidarity campaigns ("A Hug Against the Cold," "Christmas Campaigns," "Close Cycles and Open Smiles"), and recreational activities.
* **Multilanguage:** Support for Spanish (default) and English, with an easy-to-use language selector.
* **Theme Selector:** Allows users to switch between a light and a dark theme to improve accessibility and visual preference. The preference is saved in the browser.
* **Responsive Design:** Adapted to display correctly on different screen sizes (desktop, tablet, mobile).
* **Interactive Galleries:** Image carousels with thumbnails and a lightbox effect to view photos of programs, campaigns, and activities.
* **Subtle Animations:** Includes visual effects such as "emoji rain" in the campaigns and activities sections.
* **PayPal Integration:** Includes PayPal donation buttons to facilitate support for the organization.
* **Social Media Links:** Connects to ConexiÃ³n Femenina's profiles on Facebook, Instagram, and TikTok.

## Technologies Used
